[Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) is a well known game, where the player embodies a bomber, the goal being to explode the opponents/enemies to win.

Our gameplay reference is **Neo Bomberman**, released on the Neo Geo and MVS systems in 1997.

### Library <img src="./Ressources/sprites/Raylib_logo.png" height="15">

We used the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) library to create the game, which is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.
